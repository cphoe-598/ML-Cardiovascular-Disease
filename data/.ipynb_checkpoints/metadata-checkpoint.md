### About this dataset
> This dataset contains detailed information on the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It includes information on age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure values, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking habits and alcohol consumption of over 70 thousand individuals. Additionally it outlines if the person is active or not and if he or she has any cardiovascular diseases. This dataset provides a great resource for researchers to apply modern machine learning techniques to explore the potential relations between risk factors and cardiovascular disease that can ultimately lead to improved understanding of this serious health issue and design better preventive measures

### How to use the dataset
> This dataset can be used to explore the risk factors of cardiovascular disease in adults. The aim is to understand how certain demographic factors, health behaviors and biological markers affect the development of heart disease. 
>  
> To start, look through the columns of data and familiarize yourself with each one. Understand what each field means and how it relates to heart health:
> - **Age**: Age of participant (integer)
> - **Gender**: Gender of participant (male/female).
> - **Height**: Height measured in centimeters (integer) 
> - **Weight**: Weight measured in kilograms (integer) 
> - **Ap_hi**: Systolic blood pressure reading taken from patient (integer) 
> - **Ap_lo** : Diastolic blood pressure reading taken from patient (integer) 
> - **Cholesterol** : Total cholesterol level read as mg/dl on a scale 0 - 5+ units( integer). Each unit denoting increase/decrease by 20 mg/dL respectively.  
> ‐ Gluc : Glucose level read as mmol/l on a scale 0 - 16+ units( integer). Each unit denoting increase Decreaseby 1 mmol/L respectively.               ‐ Smoke  : Whether person smokes or not(binary; 0= No , 1=Yes).              ‐ Alco ​­ : Whether person drinks alcohol or not(binary; 0 =No ,1 =Yes ).                     • Active : whether person physically active or not( Binary ;0 =No,1 = Yes ).    . Cardio ­­ : whether person suffers from cardiovascular diseases or not(Binary ;0 – no , 1 ­‑yes ).Identify any trends between the different values for each attribute and the developmetn for cardiovascular disease among individuals represented by this dataset . Age, gender, weight, lifestyle practices like smoking & drinking alcohol are all key influences when analyzing this problem set. You can always modify pieces of your analysis until you're able to find patterns that will enable you make conclusions based on your understanding & exploration. You can further enrich your understanding using couple mopdeling technique like Regressions & Classification models over this dataset alongwith latest Deep Learning approach! Have Fun!

### Research Ideas
> - Analyzing the effect of lifestyle and environmental factors on the risk of cardiovascular disease.
> - Predicting the risks of different age groups based on their demographic characteristics such as gender, height, weight and smoking status.
> - Detecting patterns between levels of physical activity, blood pressure and cholesterol levels with likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease among individuals
